# gstreamer-python-text-detection
A simple text detection plugin using Gstreamer Python. This plugin provides a convenient way to integrate text detection capabilities into your GStreamer pipelines using Python. By leveraging the power of GStreamer's multimedia framework and the flexibility of Python, you can easily detect and process text from video sources in real-time.

### Prerequisites:
Before using this plugin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- tesseract: Tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) engine used for text detection. You can install it by following the instructions provided by the Tesseract project.

- gstreamer: GStreamer is a powerful multimedia framework that enables the construction of complex multimedia pipelines. Make sure you have GStreamer installed on your system before using this plugin.

### Pipeline Usage
To incorporate the text detection plugin into your GStreamer pipeline, follow these steps:

- Set the GST_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable to the current directory. This ensures that GStreamer can locate the text_detection_py plugin.

- Construct your GStreamer pipeline using the gst-launch-1.0 command. Here's an example pipeline that includes the text detection plugin:

```bash
export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=$PWD
gst-launch-1.0 -e videotestsrc \
! queue ! videoconvert \
! text_detection_py \
! videoconvert \
! x264enc ! matroskamux name=mux \
! fakesink
```
- Customize the pipeline as needed for your specific use case. You can replace the videotestsrc element with your own video source or camera input. Additionally, you can modify the other elements and their parameters based on your requirements.

- Run the GStreamer pipeline and observe the text detection results. The processed video frames will be passed through the text detection plugin, where the text will be identified and processed accordingly.

For more information on how to create GStreamer plugins using Python, refer to the GStreamer documentation and resources available online.
